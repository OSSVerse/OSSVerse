Many organizations lack internal expertise to effectively assure and remediate open-source models, creating a demand for external services such as Open-source Assurance Service Providers (OASP). Organizations require  timely support for open-source models, datasets, and projects.

!!! info "Did you know?"
    The widespread adoption of OSS (open source software) across industries has brought immense innovation but also unique security challenges. One of the barriers to OSS adoption is the lack of Trust.! :muscle:

## The solution

A Trustworthy Marketplace for Open-Source Assurance Service Providers (OASP) backed by a thriving open-source security community. Affordable and timely access to vendor neutral security services for organizations producing and consuming open-source. OASP led open source assurance service delivery would give full control over their open source components

## Considerations for an Open Source first strategy

??? question "**Supply Chain & Security Risk**"
    While open-source software can be more secure than proprietary software due to its transparency and the potential for widespread review, vulnerabilities can still exist. Organizations should have a strategy for monitoring and applying security patches and updates promptly. Assessing the security practices and history of the OSS project is crucial

??? question "**Limited Control and Support**"
    Unlike proprietary software, which typically comes with vendor support, open-source projects rely on community support or third-party vendors for troubleshooting and maintenance. Organizations must consider the availability and responsiveness of support options, including the possibility of contracting with external providers for critical applications

??? question "**Forking Cost**"
    While open-source software is often free to use, there can be costs associated with implementation, customization, support, and maintenance. A thorough cost-benefit analysis can help in understanding the total cost of ownership compared to proprietary alternatives

??? question "**Community Health and Longevity**"
    The health and sustainability of the open-source project's community are vital. A vibrant, active community suggests ongoing development and support, while a dwindling community may indicate a project at risk of becoming outdated or abandoned. Assessing the project's leadership, contribution activity, and roadmap can provide insights into its viability

??? question "**Cultural Fit**"
    The open-source philosophy emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and community contribution. Organizations should assess whether this culture aligns with their own values and practices, and be prepared to embrace these principles.

??? question "**Training and Skill Availability**"
    Adopting open-source software may require new skills or knowledge. Organizations need to consider the availability of skilled personnel, both within and outside the organization, and the potential need for training to ensure effective use and management of the OSS
