# OSSVerse: A Trusted Marketplace for Open Source Software Services

OSSVerse is a revolutionary open network designed to connect businesses with reliable open source software service providers. Imagine an ecosystem where you can easily find, evaluate, and procure trusted open source solutions. That's the vision behind OSSVerse.

## Why an Open Source Marketplace?
The widespread adoption of Open Source Software (OSS) across industries has brought immense innovation but also unique security challenges. One of the primary barriers to OSS adoption is the lack of trust. Given the vastness of the open source ecosystem, many organizations lack internal expertise or find it difficult to maintain dedicated teams to effectively evaluate, assess, and remediate open source components. Additionally, the fragmented open source vendor landscape and the complexities of managing multiple vendor support subscriptions have created a demand for external services such as Open Source Assurance Service Providers (OASP).

For organizations to sustain the power of open source solutions, they require timely support for consuming or onboarding open source components, such as open source projects, open source AI models, and open source training datasets.

### Barriers to Open Source Adoption:

- Supply chain and security risks
- Limited control and support
- Forking costs
- Incomplete security, uncertain reliability
- Fragmented knowledge

Affordable and timely access to vendor-neutral security services for organizations producing and consuming open source. OASP-led open source assurance service delivery would give full control over their open source components.
