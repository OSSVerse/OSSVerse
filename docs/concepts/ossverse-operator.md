# OSSVerse Marketplace Operator

The marketplace operator, in the context of OSSVerse that connects open source software consumers (buyers) with open source software assurance service providers (sellers), serves as a facilitator and intermediary to ensure the smooth functioning of transactions and interactions between these two groups. 

OSSVerse marketplace provides a digital venue where open source software consumers can find, evaluate, and engage services that offer assurance, such as security audits, compliance checks, and quality assessments, for open source software.
