## Why an Open Source Marketplace..

### State of open source in enterprise.

The widespread adoption of OSS (open source software) across industries has brought immense innovation but also unique security challenges. 
One of the barriers to OSS adoption is the lack of Trust.
Many organizations lack internal expertise to effectively assure and remediate open-source models, creating a demand for external services such as Open-source Assurance Service Providers (OASP).
Organizations require  timely support for open-source models, datasets, and projects. 

#### Consideration while adopting an Open source first Strategy
- Supply chain & Security Risks​
- Limited Control and support​
- Forking Costs​
- Incomplete Security​, Uncertain Reliability​
- Fragmented Knowledge​

## Solution to the problem

Affordable and timely access to vendor neutral security services for organizations producing and consuming open-source. OASP led open source assurance service delivery would give full control over their  open source components
