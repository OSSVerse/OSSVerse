## Why an Open Source Marketplace..

### State of open source in enterprise.

The widespread adoption of OSS (open source software) across industries has brought immense innovation but also unique security challenges. 
One of the barriers to OSS adoption is the lack of Trust.
Many organizations lack internal expertise to effectively assure and remediate open-source models, creating a demand for external services such as Open-source Assurance Service Providers (OASP).
Organizations require  timely support for open-source models, datasets, and projects. 

#### Consideration while adopting an Open source first Strategy
- Supply chain & Security Risks​

# FAQs on Registering and Evaluating OASPs in OSSVerse, TAVOSS Certification Process

## How do I register the first OASP when there are no OASPs registered?

Any organization or business interested in becoming an Open Source Assurance Provider (OASP) can initiate the registration process to join the OSSVerse open network. However, actual participation as an OASP is contingent upon the issuance of an OASP license. The process of registration effectively refers to the application for an OASP license. OSSVerse facilitates the issuance of OASP licenses for specific Projects of Interest (PoI) or Models of Interest (MoI) or their categories through dedicated OASP License Issuance Services. Initially, this service is provided directly by OSSVerse but may later be delegated to other ecosystem partners within the OSSVerse network who specialize in OASP license issuance and renewals.
To encourage organizations that have developed their own Open Source Software (OSS) projects to become OASPs for the OSS they have curated or seeded, OSSVerse highlights the potential monetary benefits. These benefits include remuneration for providing OSS security assurance and other support services. Additionally, OSSVerse incentivizes these organizations to engage in Assessment & Attestation services for technology PoIs and MoIs similar to their own, enhancing the verification and validation process within the network.

## How is the evaluation done when there are no OASPs with the capability to assess, despite having many registered OASPs?

In situations where the registered OASPs do not possess the skills or Projects of Interest (PoI) or Models of Interest (MoI) matching those required by a prospective OASP, the selection process becomes more open. The opportunity to curate a new BeSecure (BeS) Environment & BeS Playbook and to obtain an OASP license will be awarded to the entity that can do so at the lowest cost. It is essential for the OASP to indicate their openness to projects or models outside their current PoI and MoI and to apply for an OASP License for the new PoI or MoI as part of their service request. The additional costs associated with obtaining an OASP license can either be included in the service request or covered by the aspiring OASP. This approach ensures that even when existing OASPs lack certain capabilities, there remains a pathway for new and capable entities to join the OSSVerse as OASPs, thereby maintaining the network's growth and diversity.

## What happens when an OASP is not available with a POI and applies for OASP?

When an OASP without a Projects of Interest (POI) applies for an Open Source Assurance Provider (OASP) status, they must first publish an Open Source Assurance Report (OSAR) and obtain a TAVOSS Certificate issued by OSSVerse. The TAVOSS Certificate serves as proof of attestation by one or more OASPs, based on the OSAR report. For new projects or categories, BeSEnvironment & BeSPlaybooks need to be curated and published onto the marketplace BeSEnv & BeS Playbook Repos. The client, if aspiring to become an OASP, will receive the license in addition to the TAVOSS certificate, contingent on the attested report.

## Can Assurance Levels be tied to the quorum of Assessment?

Yes, Assurance Levels can potentially be tied to the quorum of Assessment. For instance, a client may opt for Assurance Level 1-2, which could be certified by a single OASP. For Assurance Level 3, a quorum of 3 OASPs would be required. However, the decision to tie assurance levels to the quorum has been postponed for future consideration. The certificate issued by OSSVerse is a proof of attestation by an OASP and does not directly reflect the quality of the Open Source Software (OSS). It indicates that the OASP has validated the BeS Environment & BeSPlaybooks for the project.

## What happens if an OSAR is unsatisfactory?

An unsatisfactory OSAR can result from either inadequate assessment or inherent problems within the project. In the case of inadequate assessment, neither a license nor a TAVOSS certificate will be issued. If the issue lies with inherent problems in the project, a license may still be granted, but not the TAVOSS certificate. This differentiation ensures that only projects meeting certain standards receive full certification.

## What is the process for issuing a TAVOSS Certification?

The issuance of a TAVOSS Certification is the final step in the process, conducted by the OSSVerse Certification service. This step comes after establishing the validity of all proofs submitted by OASPs, either individually or as part of a quorum (i.e., multi-party attestation). The certification is a testament that the OASP has validated the BeS Environment & BeSPlaybooks for the project, and that the execution and verification of the playbooks in the OSAR have been satisfactorily completed.

# FAQ: Understanding OSAR and Its Connection to Certificates and Attestation

## What is an OSAR?

An Open Source Assessment Report (OSAR) is the output produced by executing the BeSPlaybook. It serves as a detailed document that outlines the findings and outcomes of the assessment process.

## How does an OSAR differ from a certificate?

An OSAR is a comprehensive assessment report, while a certificate, specifically a TAVOSS Certificate, is an official recognition issued by OSSVerse. The certificate is awarded after validating the proof of attestation, which is derived from the OSAR, thereby certifying that the assessment meets certain predefined standards.

## What role does an OSAR play in the certification process?

The OSAR is crucial in the certification process as it provides the necessary evidence from which a proof of attestation is generated. This proof of attestation is then validated by the OSSVerse certification service, leading to the issuance of a TAVOSS Certificate.

## How is a TAVOSS Certificate issued based on an OSAR?

A TAVOSS Certificate is issued by OSSVerse once the proof of attestation, which is based on the evidence provided by the OSAR, is validated. This ensures that the assessment adheres to the standards set by OSSVerse.

## Are there any plans to evolve the format of the OSAR?

Yes, there are future plans to make the OSAR's output format compliant with an open attestation standard, such as the CycloneDX Attestation standard. This initiative aims to standardize the format for broader acceptance and interoperability.

# FAQ: Onboarding and Licensing Process in OSSVerse with Emphasis on Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR

## Is it mandatory for an Open Source Assurance Provider (OASP) to have a TAVOSS-certified project in order to join OSSVerse?

No, an Open Source Assurance Provider (OASP) does not need to have a TAVOSS certified project to onboard onto OSSVerse. An OASP can cater to Assurance Level 1-2 by conducting minimal assessments and providing Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR. TAVOSS certification is applicable to the OSSProject itself, not the OASP. An OASP receives a license for a specific OSSProject or a category of OSSProjects within OSSVerse.

## Can an OASP cater only to lower assurance levels without TAVOSS certification?

Yes, an OASP can focus exclusively on Assurance Level 1-2 without the need for TAVOSS certification. For these levels, the OASP is required to conduct necessary assessments and provide Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR.

## How does an OSSProject obtain TAVOSS certification? 

An OSSProject is awarded TAVOSS Certification by OSSVerse after the OSSVerse Certifying Service validates the Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSARs submitted by various OASPs. This process involves executing BeSPlaybooks in BeSEnvironments within their BeSLabs, validating the BeSPlaybooks, verifying the results, and attesting the OSAR. The OASP then presents this proof to the OSSVerse Certifying Service as part of the TAVOSS certification process for the OSSProject.

## What role does an OASP play in the TAVOSS certification process?

An OASP is instrumental in the TAVOSS certification process for an OSSProject by conducting thorough assessments. This includes executing BeSPlaybooks in BeSEnvironments, validating these playbooks, verifying assessment results, and attesting the OSAR. The OASP must then provide Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR to the OSSVerse Certifying Service, facilitating the TAVOSS certification for the OSSProject.

## Can an OASP that caters to Assurance Level 3+ demonstrate their competence without TAVOSS certification? 

Although an OASP itself does not receive TAVOSS certification, they can demonstrate their competence in catering to Assurance Level 3+ through the successful facilitation of the TAVOSS certification process for OSSProjects. Their capability to conduct comprehensive assessments and provide validated Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR showcases their expertise and competence at higher assurance levels.

## What is the significance of providing Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR for an OASP?

Providing Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR is significant for an OASP as it evidences their capability to assess and assure OSSProjects at specified levels. For Assurance Level 1-2, this proof reflects the OASP's ability to conduct minimal assessments and ensure basic security and reliability standards. This documentation is a crucial part of the OASP's credentials within the OSSVerse ecosystem, demonstrating their assessment and attestation capabilities.

# FAQ: Setting Up and Utilizing BeS Lab for Businesses

## What are the prerequisites for becoming an OASP (Open Source Assurance Provider)? 

To qualify as an OASP, the following conditions must be met:
a. Obtain an OSAR (Open Source Assurance Report) or TAVOSS (Trustworthy AI & Value Open Source Software) Certificate for the project or category of projects.
b. Curate a BeS Lab.
c. Enable Beckn (to register in the OSSVerse marketplace).

## When is the BeS Lab set up for an OASP? 

The BeS Lab can be set up after obtaining the necessary reports, certificates, and the license. This setup enables the OASP to conduct subsequent assessments. Alternatively, the BeS Lab can be established at the beginning for self-assessment purposes, in addition to assessments conducted by other registered OASPs. It's important to note that the BeS Lab settings require customization based on the specific project needs of the business.

## Is a BeS Lab necessary for businesses not interested in becoming an OASP on OSSVerse?

No, setting up a BeS Lab is optional for businesses that do not aim to become an OASP on OSSVerse. Any business interested in using the BeS Lab as a tooling platform for their Open Source Program Office (OSPO) or in becoming an OASP in the future can set up their own BeS Lab. Additionally, selected OASPs or dedicated OSSVerse ecosystem participants, such as BeSLabs like O31E, can offer BeS Lab setup services to businesses for a fee. However, for businesses intending to participate in OSSVerse as an OASP, having a BeS Lab and publishing a catalog of their services, Projects of Interest (OSSPoI), or Models of Interest (OSSMoI) is mandatory to be discoverable by other businesses on OSSVerse.

## Can you explain what it means when Projects of Interest (PoIs) match? 

When PoIs match, it signifies that an OASP can provide evidence of having assessed open source projects with a technology stack similar to that outlined in the OSSProject or OSSModel card. This means the OASP can show they have executed BeSPlaybook in BeSEnvironments for a project similar to the one a business is seeking support for and have generated an OSAR for that OSSProject/OSS Model.

## Does including a new Project of Interest (PoI) necessitate a new license for an OASP? 

Yes, whenever a new PoI is added, OSSVerse may issue a new license to an OASP. This occurs each time the OSSVerse license issuance service validates the OSAR submitted by an OASP for the newly included PoI.
