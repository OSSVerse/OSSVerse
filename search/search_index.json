However, actual participation as an OASP is contingent upon the issuance of an OASP license. The process of registration effectively refers to the application for an OASP license. OSSVerse facilitates the issuance of OASP licenses for specific Projects of Interest (PoI) or Models of Interest (MoI) or their categories through dedicated OASP License Issuance Services. Initially, this service is provided directly by OSSVerse but may later be delegated to other ecosystem partners within the OSSVerse network who specialize in OASP license issuance and renewals. To encourage organizations that have developed their own Open Source Software (OSS) projects to become OASPs for the OSS they have curated or seeded, OSSVerse highlights the potential monetary benefits. These benefits include remuneration for providing OSS security assurance and other support services. Additionally, OSSVerse incentivizes these organizations to engage in Assessment & Attestation services for technology PoIs and MoIs similar to their own, enhancing the verification and validation process within the network. How is the evaluation done when there are no OASPs with the capability to assess, despite having many registered OASPs? \u00b6 In situations where the registered OASPs do not possess the skills or Projects of Interest (PoI) or Models of Interest (MoI) matching those required by a prospective OASP, the selection process becomes more open. The opportunity to curate a new BeSecure (BeS) Environment & BeS Playbook and to obtain an OASP license will be awarded to the entity that can do so at the lowest cost. It is essential for the OASP to indicate their openness to projects or models outside their current PoI and MoI and to apply for an OASP License for the new PoI or MoI as part of their service request. The additional costs associated with obtaining an OASP license can either be included in the service request or covered by the aspiring OASP. This approach ensures that even when existing OASPs lack certain capabilities, there remains a pathway for new and capable entities to join the OSSVerse as OASPs, thereby maintaining the network's growth and diversity. What happens when an OASP is not available with a POI and applies for OASP? \u00b6 When an OASP without a Projects of Interest (POI) applies for an Open Source Assurance Provider (OASP) status, they must first publish an Open Source Assurance Report (OSAR) and obtain a TAVOSS Certificate issued by OSSVerse. The TAVOSS Certificate serves as proof of attestation by one or more OASPs, based on the OSAR report. For new projects or categories, BeSEnvironment & BeSPlaybooks need to be curated and published onto the marketplace BeSEnv & BeS Playbook Repos. The client, if aspiring to become an OASP, will receive the license in addition to the TAVOSS certificate, contingent on the attested report. Can Assurance Levels be tied to the quorum of Assessment? \u00b6 Yes, Assurance Levels can potentially be tied to the quorum of Assessment. For instance, a client may opt for Assurance Level 1-2, which could be certified by a single OASP. For Assurance Level 3, a quorum of 3 OASPs would be required. However, the decision to tie assurance levels to the quorum has been postponed for future consideration. The certificate issued by OSSVerse is a proof of attestation by an OASP and does not directly reflect the quality of the Open Source Software (OSS). It indicates that the OASP has validated the BeS Environment & BeSPlaybooks for the project. What happens if an OSAR is unsatisfactory? \u00b6 An unsatisfactory OSAR can result from either inadequate assessment or inherent problems within the project. In the case of inadequate assessment, neither a license nor a TAVOSS certificate will be issued. If the issue lies with inherent problems in the project, a license may still be granted, but not the TAVOSS certificate. This differentiation ensures that only projects meeting certain standards receive full certification. What is the process for issuing a TAVOSS Certification? \u00b6 The issuance of a TAVOSS Certification is the final step in the process, conducted by the OSSVerse Certification service. This step comes after establishing the validity of all proofs submitted by OASPs, either individually or as part of a quorum (i.e., multi-party attestation). The certification is a testament that the OASP has validated the BeS Environment & BeSPlaybooks for the project, and that the execution and verification of the playbooks in the OSAR have been satisfactorily completed. Understanding OSAR and Its Connection to Certificates and Attestation \u00b6 What is an OSAR? \u00b6 An Open Source Assessment Report (OSAR) is the output produced by executing the BeSPlaybook. It serves as a detailed document that outlines the findings and outcomes of the assessment process. How does an OSAR differ from a certificate? \u00b6 An OSAR is a comprehensive assessment report, while a certificate, specifically a TAVOSS Certificate, is an official recognition issued by OSSVerse. The certificate is awarded after validating the proof of attestation, which is derived from the OSAR, thereby certifying that the assessment meets certain predefined standards. What role does an OSAR play in the certification process? \u00b6 The OSAR is crucial in the certification process as it provides the necessary evidence from which a proof of attestation is generated. This proof of attestation is then validated by the OSSVerse certification service, leading to the issuance of a TAVOSS Certificate. How is a TAVOSS Certificate issued based on an OSAR? \u00b6 A TAVOSS Certificate is issued by OSSVerse once the proof of attestation, which is based on the evidence provided by the OSAR, is validated. This ensures that the assessment adheres to the standards set by OSSVerse. Are there any plans to evolve the format of the OSAR? \u00b6 Yes, there are future plans to make the OSAR's output format compliant with an open attestation standard, such as the CycloneDX Attestation standard. This initiative aims to standardize the format for broader acceptance and interoperability. Onboarding and Licensing Process in OSSVerse with Emphasis on Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR \u00b6 Is it mandatory for an Open Source Assurance Provider (OASP) to have a TAVOSS-certified project in order to join OSSVerse? \u00b6 No, an Open Source Assurance Provider (OASP) does not need to have a TAVOSS certified project to onboard onto OSSVerse. An OASP can cater to Assurance Level 1-2 by conducting minimal assessments and providing Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR. TAVOSS certification is applicable to the OSSProject itself, not the OASP. An OASP receives a license for a specific OSSProject or a category of OSSProjects within OSSVerse. Can an OASP cater only to lower assurance levels without TAVOSS certification? \u00b6 Yes, an OASP can focus exclusively on Assurance Level 1-2 without the need for TAVOSS certification. For these levels, the OASP is required to conduct necessary assessments and provide Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR. How does an OSSProject obtain TAVOSS certification? \u00b6 An OSSProject is awarded TAVOSS Certification by OSSVerse after the OSSVerse Certifying Service validates the Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSARs submitted by various OASPs. This process involves executing BeSPlaybooks in BeSEnvironments within their BeSLabs, validating the BeSPlaybooks, verifying the results, and attesting the OSAR. The OASP then presents this proof to the OSSVerse Certifying Service as part of the TAVOSS certification process for the OSSProject. What role does an OASP play in the TAVOSS certification process? \u00b6 An OASP is instrumental in the TAVOSS certification process for an OSSProject by conducting thorough assessments. This includes executing BeSPlaybooks in BeSEnvironments, validating these playbooks, verifying assessment results, and attesting the OSAR. The OASP must then provide Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR to the OSSVerse Certifying Service, facilitating the TAVOSS certification for the OSSProject. Can an OASP that caters to Assurance Level 3+ demonstrate their competence without TAVOSS certification? \u00b6 Although an OASP itself does not receive TAVOSS certification, they can demonstrate their competence in catering to Assurance Level 3+ through the successful facilitation of the TAVOSS certification process for OSSProjects. Their capability to conduct comprehensive assessments and provide validated Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR showcases their expertise and competence at higher assurance levels. What is the significance of providing Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR for an OASP? \u00b6 Providing Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR is significant for an OASP as it evidences their capability to assess and assure OSSProjects at specified levels. For Assurance Level 1-2, this proof reflects the OASP's ability to conduct minimal assessments and ensure basic security and reliability standards. This documentation is a crucial part of the OASP's credentials within the OSSVerse ecosystem, demonstrating their assessment and attestation capabilities. Setting Up and Utilizing BeS Lab for Businesses \u00b6 What are the prerequisites for becoming an OASP (Open Source Assurance Provider)? \u00b6 To qualify as an OASP, the following conditions must be met: a. Obtain an OSAR (Open Source Assurance Report) or TAVOSS (Trustworthy AI & Value Open Source Software) Certificate for the project or category of projects. b. Curate a BeS Lab. c. Enable Beckn (to register in the OSSVerse marketplace). When is the BeS Lab set up for an OASP? \u00b6 The BeS Lab can be set up after obtaining the necessary reports, certificates, and the license. This setup enables the OASP to conduct subsequent assessments. Alternatively, the BeS Lab can be established at the beginning for self-assessment purposes, in addition to assessments conducted by other registered OASPs. It's important to note that the BeS Lab settings require customization based on the specific project needs of the business. Is a BeS Lab necessary for businesses not interested in becoming an OASP on OSSVerse? \u00b6 No, setting up a BeS Lab is optional for businesses that do not aim to become an OASP on OSSVerse. Any business interested in using the BeS Lab as a tooling platform for their Open Source Program Office (OSPO) or in becoming an OASP in the future can set up their own BeS Lab. Additionally, selected OASPs or dedicated OSSVerse ecosystem participants, such as BeSLabs like O31E, can offer BeS Lab setup services to businesses for a fee. However, for businesses intending to participate in OSSVerse as an OASP, having a BeS Lab and publishing a catalog of their services, Projects of Interest (OSSPoI), or Models of Interest (OSSMoI) is mandatory to be discoverable by other businesses on OSSVerse. Can you explain what it means when Projects of Interest (PoIs) match? \u00b6 When PoIs match, it signifies that an OASP can provide evidence of having assessed open source projects with a technology stack similar to that outlined in the OSSProject or OSSModel card. This means the OASP can show they have executed BeSPlaybook in BeSEnvironments for a project similar to the one a business is seeking support for and have generated an OSAR for that OSSProject/OSS Model. Does including a new Project of Interest (PoI) necessitate a new license for an OASP? \u00b6 Yes, whenever a new PoI is added, OSSVerse may issue a new license to an OASP. This occurs each time the OSSVerse license issuance service validates the OSAR submitted by an OASP for the newly included PoI.","title":"FAQs"},{"location":"concepts/OSSVerseFAQ/#faqs","text":"","title":"FAQs"},{"location":"concepts/OSSVerseFAQ/#registering-and-evaluating-oasps-in-ossverse-tavoss-certification-process","text":"","title":"Registering and Evaluating OASPs in OSSVerse, TAVOSS Certification Process"},{"location":"concepts/OSSVerseFAQ/#how-do-i-register-the-first-oasp-when-there-are-no-oasps-registered","text":"Any organization or business interested in becoming an Open Source Assurance Provider (OASP) can initiate the registration process to join the OSSVerse open network.

This approach ensures that even when existing OASPs lack certain capabilities, there remains a pathway for new and capable entities to join the OSSVerse as OASPs, thereby maintaining the network's growth and diversity. What happens when an OASP is not available with a POI and applies for OASP? When an OASP without a Projects of Interest (POI) applies for an Open Source Assurance Provider (OASP) status, they must first publish an Open Source Assurance Report (OSAR) and obtain a TAVOSS Certificate issued by OSSVerse. The TAVOSS Certificate serves as proof of attestation by one or more OASPs, based on the OSAR report. For new projects or categories, BeSEnvironment & BeSPlaybooks need to be curated and published onto the marketplace BeSEnv & BeS Playbook Repos. The client, if aspiring to become an OASP, will receive the license in addition to the TAVOSS certificate, contingent on the attested report. Can Assurance Levels be tied to the quorum of Assessment? Yes, Assurance Levels can potentially be tied to the quorum of Assessment. For instance, a client may opt for Assurance Level 1-2, which could be certified by a single OASP. For Assurance Level 3, a quorum of 3 OASPs would be required. However, the decision to tie assurance levels to the quorum has been postponed for future consideration. The certificate issued by OSSVerse is a proof of attestation by an OASP and does not directly reflect the quality of the Open Source Software (OSS). It indicates that the OASP has validated the BeS Environment & BeSPlaybooks for the project. What happens if an OSAR is unsatisfactory? An unsatisfactory OSAR can result from either inadequate assessment or inherent problems within the project. In the case of inadequate assessment, neither a license nor a TAVOSS certificate will be issued. If the issue lies with inherent problems in the project, a license may still be granted, but not the TAVOSS certificate. This differentiation ensures that only projects meeting certain standards receive full certification. What is the process for issuing a TAVOSS Certification? The issuance of a TAVOSS Certification is the final step in the process, conducted by the OSSVerse Certification service. This step comes after establishing the validity of all proofs submitted by OASPs, either individually or as part of a quorum (i.e., multi-party attestation). The certification is a testament that the OASP has validated the BeS Environment & BeSPlaybooks for the project, and that the execution and verification of the playbooks in the OSAR have been satisfactorily completed.","title":"Registering and Evaluating OASPs in OSSVerse, TAVOSS Certification Process"},{"location":"concepts/faq/#osar-its-connection-to-certificates-and-attestation","text":"What is an OSAR? An Open Source Assessment Report (OSAR) is the output produced by executing the BeSPlaybook. It serves as a detailed document that outlines the findings and outcomes of the assessment process. How does an OSAR differ from a certificate? An OSAR is a comprehensive assessment report, while a certificate, specifically a TAVOSS Certificate, is an official recognition issued by OSSVerse. The certificate is awarded after validating the proof of attestation, which is derived from the OSAR, thereby certifying that the assessment meets certain predefined standards. What role does an OSAR play in the certification process? The OSAR is crucial in the certification process as it provides the necessary evidence from which a proof of attestation is generated. This proof of attestation is then validated by the OSSVerse certification service, leading to the issuance of a TAVOSS Certificate. How is a TAVOSS Certificate issued based on an OSAR? A TAVOSS Certificate is issued by OSSVerse once the proof of attestation, which is based on the evidence provided by the OSAR, is validated. This ensures that the assessment adheres to the standards set by OSSVerse. Are there any plans to evolve the format of the OSAR? Yes, there are future plans to make the OSAR's output format compliant with an open attestation standard, such as the CycloneDX Attestation standard. This initiative aims to standardize the format for broader acceptance and interoperability.","title":"OSAR : Its connection to certificates and attestation"},{"location":"concepts/faq/#onboarding-and-licensing-process-in-ossverse-with-emphasis-on-proof-of-assessmentattestation-of-osar","text":"Is it mandatory for an Open Source Assurance Provider (OASP) to have a TAVOSS-certified project in order to join OSSVerse? No, an Open Source Assurance Provider (OASP) does not need to have a TAVOSS certified project to onboard onto OSSVerse. An OASP can cater to Assurance Level 1-2 by conducting minimal assessments and providing Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR. TAVOSS certification is applicable to the OSSProject itself, not the OASP. An OASP receives a license for a specific OSSProject or a category of OSSProjects within OSSVerse. Can an OASP cater only to lower assurance levels without TAVOSS certification? Yes, an OASP can focus exclusively on Assurance Level 1-2 without the need for TAVOSS certification. For these levels, the OASP is required to conduct necessary assessments and provide Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR. How does an OSSProject obtain TAVOSS certification? An OSSProject is awarded TAVOSS Certification by OSSVerse after the OSSVerse Certifying Service validates the Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSARs submitted by various OASPs. This process involves executing BeSPlaybooks in BeSEnvironments within their BeSLabs, validating the BeSPlaybooks, verifying the results, and attesting the OSAR. The OASP then presents this proof to the OSSVerse Certifying Service as part of the TAVOSS certification process for the OSSProject. What role does an OASP play in the TAVOSS certification process? An OASP is instrumental in the TAVOSS certification process for an OSSProject by conducting thorough assessments. This includes executing BeSPlaybooks in BeSEnvironments, validating these playbooks, verifying assessment results, and attesting the OSAR. The OASP must then provide Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR to the OSSVerse Certifying Service, facilitating the TAVOSS certification for the OSSProject. Can an OASP that caters to Assurance Level 3+ demonstrate their competence without TAVOSS certification? Although an OASP itself does not receive TAVOSS certification, they can demonstrate their competence in catering to Assurance Level 3+ through the successful facilitation of the TAVOSS certification process for OSSProjects. Their capability to conduct comprehensive assessments and provide validated Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR showcases their expertise and competence at higher assurance levels. What is the significance of providing Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR for an OASP? Providing Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR is significant for an OASP as it evidences their capability to assess and assure OSSProjects at specified levels. For Assurance Level 1-2, this proof reflects the OASP's ability to conduct minimal assessments and ensure basic security and reliability standards. This documentation is a crucial part of the OASP's credentials within the OSSVerse ecosystem, demonstrating their assessment and attestation capabilities.","title":"Onboarding and Licensing Process in OSSVerse with Emphasis on Proof of Assessment/Attestation of OSAR"},{"location":"concepts/faq/#setting-up-and-utilizing-bes-lab-for-businesses","text":"What are the prerequisites for becoming an OASP (Open Source Assurance Provider)? To qualify as an OASP, the following conditions must be met: a. Obtain an OSAR (Open Source Assurance Report) or TAVOSS (Trustworthy AI & Value Open Source Software) Certificate for the project or category of projects. b. Curate a BeS Lab. c. Enable Beckn (to register in the OSSVerse marketplace). When is the BeS Lab set up for an OASP? The BeS Lab can be set up after obtaining the necessary reports, certificates, and the license. This setup enables the OASP to conduct subsequent assessments. Alternatively, the BeS Lab can be established at the beginning for self-assessment purposes, in addition to assessments conducted by other registered OASPs. It's important to note that the BeS Lab settings require customization based on the specific project needs of the business. Is a BeS Lab necessary for businesses not interested in becoming an OASP on OSSVerse? No, setting up a BeS Lab is optional for businesses that do not aim to become an OASP on OSSVerse. Any business interested in using the BeS Lab as a tooling platform for their Open Source Program Office (OSPO) or in becoming an OASP in the future can set up their own BeS Lab. Additionally, selected OASPs or dedicated OSSVerse ecosystem participants, such as BeSLabs like O31E, can offer BeS Lab setup services to businesses for a fee. However, for businesses intending to participate in OSSVerse as an OASP, having a BeS Lab and publishing a catalog of their services, Projects of Interest (OSSPoI), or Models of Interest (OSSMoI) is mandatory to be discoverable by other businesses on OSSVerse. Can you explain what it means when Projects of Interest (PoIs) match? When PoIs match, it signifies that an OASP can provide evidence of having assessed open source projects with a technology stack similar to that outlined in the OSSProject or OSSModel card. This means the OASP can show they have executed BeSPlaybook in BeSEnvironments for a project similar to the one a business is seeking support for and have generated an OSAR for that OSSProject/OSS Model. Does including a new Project of Interest (PoI) necessitate a new license for an OASP? Yes, whenever a new PoI is added, OSSVerse may issue a new license to an OASP. This occurs each time the OSSVerse license issuance service validates the OSAR submitted by an OASP for the newly included PoI.","title":"Setting Up and Utilizing BeS Lab for Businesses"},{"location":"concepts/oss-assurance-provider/","text":"Open Source Assurance Service Provider (OASP) \u00b6 Open Source Assurance Service Provider (OASP): Provide validation, verification, attestation, and support services.

Building a cloud Landing Zone is complex, especially since most companies have little or no expertise in this area. And it can take a significant amount of time to get it right. Leverage a reference architecture to give you an AWS Landing Zone that provides a consistent and solid \"foundations\" to bootstrap your project in the cloud. The code solution implements the best AWS Well-Architected Framework practices as well as the battle-tested tech experience and years of knowledge of our contributors. Hours or days, not weeks or months Leverage implements infrastructure as code at all times. We have rolled this out using Terraform, and has been fully proven in AWS and other Terraform providers that are part of our reference architecture like Kubernetes, Helm and Hashicorp Vault. By using the Leverage CLI , our binary will help you to quickly bootstrap your AWS Landing Zone in a matter of hours (or at most a few days). OSSVerse for Open Source Projects and ML Model Producers \u00b6 It's not just a pile of scripts It's not just another layer of untested, one time and stand-alone developed scripts. The code is modularized and well designed under best practices, our Leverage CLI has both unit and integration tests. While our Terraform code has been extensively E2E tested. Moreover, 100% of the code is yours (to modify, extend, reuse, etc), with no vendor locking and vendor licensing fees. We use the MIT license, so you can take the code, modify it and use it as your private code. All we ask in return is a friendly greeting and that (if possible) consider contributing to binbash Leverage project. Implement Leverage yourself or we can deploy it for you! DevOps culture and methodologies Team agility and continuous improvements based on feedback loops are some of the main drivers of cloud adoption, and IAC's goal of reducing the frequency of deployment of both infrastructure and applications are some of the most important aspects of DevOps practices. We continue to apply these methodologies to achieve a DevOps first culture. We have experienced and demonstrated their potential and have practiced them in dozens of projects over the past 5 years. The Leverage reference architecture for AWS combines a set of application best practices, technology patterns and a common CI/CD deployment approach through Leverage CLI for all your application environments. As a result, we are pursuing a world-class software delivery performance through optimized collaboration, communication, reliability, stability, scalability and security at ever-decreasing cost and effort. Repeatable, composable and extensible immutable infrastructure The best high-performance development teams create and recreate their development and production environments using infrastructure as code (IaC) as part of their daily development processes. The Leverage CLI allows to build repeatable and immutable infrastructure. So your cloud development, staging and production environments will consistently be the same. OSSVerse for Open Source Assurance Service Providers \u00b6 Provisioning infrastructure as code (Iac) Instead of manually provisioning infrastructure, the real benefits of cloud adoption come from orchestrating infrastructure through code. However, this is really challenging to achieve, there are literally thousands of tiny things and configs to consider and they all seem to take forever. Our experience is that it can take teams up to 24 months to achieve a desired infra state in AWS. By using Leverage you could get your AWS Landing-Zone in few weeks, or your entire AWS Well-Architected based cloud solution within 1 to 3 months (depending on your project complexity needs). We've done it before (don't reinvent the wheel) Often, development teams have similar and recurring requests such as: iam, networking, security, storage, databases, compute and secret management, etc. binbash Leverage has been proven in dozen of project to create software-defined (IaC) AWS environments. Best practices baked in the code Leverage provides IaC reference architecture for AWS hosted applications infrastructure. This is baked into the code as a combination of the best AWS Well-Architected framework practices and the experience of having successfully orchestrated many customers to AWS cloud. On-demand infra deployment Leverage provides your DevOps, Cloud, SRE and Development teams with the ability to provision on-demand infrastructure, granting that it will meet the rigorous security requirements of modern cloud native best practices. It fully implements AWS Well-Architected Framework (WAF) and best DevOps practices, including practices, including collaboration, version control, CI/CD, continuous testing, cloud infrastructure and losely couple architectures. Easier to support and maintain Leverage IaC approach significantly reduce your AWS infra deployment, config and support burden and reduce risk. Our code backed provisioning has been rigorously tested many times, eliminating the possibility of manual errors. Because the entire infrastructure is deployed from the same proven code, the consistency your cloud environments will simplify your setup and maintenance. Use the versioned code to iterate and improve, extend or compose your internal processes as your cloud operating model evolves. There is no vendor lock-in. You own the solution With Leverage you own 100% of the code with no lock-in clauses. If you choose to leave Leverage , you will still have your entire AWS cloud infrastructure that you can access and manage. If you drop Leverage , you will still have your entire cloud native infrastructure code (Terraform, Helm, Ansible, Python). It\u2019s 100% Open Source on GitHub and is free to use with no strings attached under MIT license (no licensing fees), and you are free to commercially and privately use, distribute and modify.","title":"Roles you can play"},{"location":"concepts/roles-you-can-play/#ossverse-for-open-source-projects-and-ml-model-consumers","text":"Accelerate development and optimize costs Annual cost savings are a new standard and best practice.

The code is modularized and well designed under best practices, our Leverage CLI has both unit and integration tests. While our Terraform code has been extensively E2E tested. Moreover, 100% of the code is yours (to modify, extend, reuse, etc), with no vendor locking and vendor licensing fees. We use the MIT license, so you can take the code, modify it and use it as your private code. All we ask in return is a friendly greeting and that (if possible) consider contributing to binbash Leverage project. Implement Leverage yourself or we can deploy it for you! DevOps culture and methodologies Team agility and continuous improvements based on feedback loops are some of the main drivers of cloud adoption, and IAC's goal of reducing the frequency of deployment of both infrastructure and applications are some of the most important aspects of DevOps practices. We continue to apply these methodologies to achieve a DevOps first culture. We have experienced and demonstrated their potential and have practiced them in dozens of projects over the past 5 years. The Leverage reference architecture for AWS combines a set of application best practices, technology patterns and a common CI/CD deployment approach through Leverage CLI for all your application environments. As a result, we are pursuing a world-class software delivery performance through optimized collaboration, communication, reliability, stability, scalability and security at ever-decreasing cost and effort. Repeatable, composable and extensible immutable infrastructure The best high-performance development teams create and recreate their development and production environments using infrastructure as code (IaC) as part of their daily development processes. The Leverage CLI allows to build repeatable and immutable infrastructure. So your cloud development, staging and production environments will consistently be the same.","title":"OSSVerse for Open Source Projects and ML Model Producers"},{"location":"concepts/roles-you-can-play/#ossverse-for-open-source-assurance-service-providers","text":"Provisioning infrastructure as code (Iac) Instead of manually provisioning infrastructure, the real benefits of cloud adoption come from orchestrating infrastructure through code. However, this is really challenging to achieve, there are literally thousands of tiny things and configs to consider and they all seem to take forever. Our experience is that it can take teams up to 24 months to achieve a desired infra state in AWS. By using Leverage you could get your AWS Landing-Zone in few weeks, or your entire AWS Well-Architected based cloud solution within 1 to 3 months (depending on your project complexity needs). We've done it before (don't reinvent the wheel) Often, development teams have similar and recurring requests such as: iam, networking, security, storage, databases, compute and secret management, etc. binbash Leverage has been proven in dozen of project to create software-defined (IaC) AWS environments. Best practices baked in the code Leverage provides IaC reference architecture for AWS hosted applications infrastructure. This is baked into the code as a combination of the best AWS Well-Architected framework practices and the experience of having successfully orchestrated many customers to AWS cloud. On-demand infra deployment Leverage provides your DevOps, Cloud, SRE and Development teams with the ability to provision on-demand infrastructure, granting that it will meet the rigorous security requirements of modern cloud native best practices. It fully implements AWS Well-Architected Framework (WAF) and best DevOps practices, including practices, including collaboration, version control, CI/CD, continuous testing, cloud infrastructure and losely couple architectures. Easier to support and maintain Leverage IaC approach significantly reduce your AWS infra deployment, config and support burden and reduce risk. Our code backed provisioning has been rigorously tested many times, eliminating the possibility of manual errors. Because the entire infrastructure is deployed from the same proven code, the consistency your cloud environments will simplify your setup and maintenance. Use the versioned code to iterate and improve, extend or compose your internal processes as your cloud operating model evolves. There is no vendor lock-in. You own the solution With Leverage you own 100% of the code with no lock-in clauses. If you choose to leave Leverage , you will still have your entire AWS cloud infrastructure that you can access and manage. If you drop Leverage , you will still have your entire cloud native infrastructure code (Terraform, Helm, Ansible, Python). It\u2019s 100% Open Source on GitHub and is free to use with no strings attached under MIT license (no licensing fees), and you are free to commercially and privately use, distribute and modify.","title":"OSSVerse for Open Source Assurance Service Providers"},{"location":"concepts/why-ossverse/","text":"Many organizations lack internal expertise to effectively assure and remediate open-source models, creating a demand for external services such as Open-source Assurance Service Providers (OASP).

Repeatability: Allows your infra to be automatically instantiated, making it easy to build multiple identical envs. Troubleshooting: Check source control and see exactly what changed in the env. As long as you are diligent and don\u2019t make manual envs changes, then IaC can be a game changer. DR: Require the ability to set up an alternate env in a different DC or Region. IaC makes this a much more manageable prospect. Auditability: You will need to be able to audit both changes and access to an env, IaC gives you this right out of the box. Visibility: As an env expands over time, is challenging to tell what has been provisioned. In the #cloud this can be a huge #cost issue. IaC allows tracking your resources. Portability: Some IaC techs are #multicloud. Also, translating #Terraform from one cloud provider to another is considerably more simple than recreating your entire envs in a cloud-specific tool. Security: See history of changes to your SG rules along with commit messages can do wonders for being confident about the security configs of your envs. Terraform allows to codify your application infrastructure, reduce human error and increase automation by provisioning infrastructure as code.
