These services are critical in identifying vulnerabilities, ensuring legal compliance, and maintaining the overall integrity and reliability of open source software. OASPs play a vital role in the open source ecosystem by providing expertise and services that help in mitigating the risks associated with using open source components in both commercial and non-commercial software projects. Role and Services Offered: Vulnerability Assessment and Management : OASPs conduct thorough assessments of open source software to identify security vulnerabilities. They provide detailed reports on identified vulnerabilities and offer recommendations or patches to mitigate these risks. Compliance and Licensing : They ensure that the use of open source software complies with various open source licenses. This includes identifying licensing obligations, preventing license conflicts, and ensuring that software distributions comply with the terms of open source licenses. Quality Assurance : Beyond security and compliance, OASPs also evaluate the quality of open source software. This can include code reviews, performance testing, and other quality assurance processes to ensure that the software meets certain standards before it is deployed. Security Auditing and Certification: Some OASPs offer formal security auditing services, where they scrutinize the open source software for security flaws and certify its security posture. This certification can be crucial for organizations that require a certain level of assurance before integrating open source components into their projects. Patch Management and Security Updates : They provide ongoing services to manage patches and security updates for open source software, ensuring that the software remains secure against newly discovered vulnerabilities over time. Community Engagement and Contribution : Many OASPs actively engage with and contribute to the open source community. This can include reporting vulnerabilities, contributing patches, and participating in open source projects to improve their security. Importance in the Ecosystem \u00b6 The role of OASPs is crucial in the open source ecosystem. They bridge the gap between the open nature of open source software and the security and compliance requirements of its users, especially in enterprise environments. By providing these specialized services, OASPs enable organizations to leverage the benefits of open source software while managing the associated risks effectively. This not only supports the sustainability and growth of open source projects but also ensures that organizations can maintain high standards of security and compliance in their software development practices.","title":"OASP"},{"location":"concepts/oss-assurance-provider/#open-source-assurance-service-providers","text":"Open Source Software Assurance Service Providers (OASPs) are entities or individuals that offer a range of services aimed at ensuring the security, compliance, and quality of open source software (OSS) for consumers.

Profits are being targeted to business development, regulatory and compliance needs. Resulting in a reduction of pressure on IT and development budgets, granting the opportunity to focus in new features and boost innovation. Modernize applications architecture (loosely coupled and modular) Strategically decompose the monolith into a fine-grained, loosely coupled modular architecture to increase both development and business agility. When the system architecture is designed to allow teams to test, deploy and change systems without relying on other teams, they require little communication to get the job done. In other words, both the architecture and the teams are loosely coupled. Innovation - Rapidly adopt new technologies and reduce development time Use Leverage Reference Architecture and for AWS + our libraries to provide a collection of cloud application architecture components to build and deploy faster in the cloud. Building a cloud Landing Zone is complex, especially since most companies have little or no expertise in this area. And it can take a significant amount of time to get it right. Leverage a reference architecture to give you an AWS Landing Zone that provides a consistent and solid \"foundations\" to bootstrap your project in the cloud. The code solution implements the best AWS Well-Architected Framework practices as well as the battle-tested tech experience and years of knowledge of our contributors. Hours or days, not weeks or months Leverage implements infrastructure as code at all times. We have rolled this out using Terraform, and has been fully proven in AWS and other Terraform providers that are part of our reference architecture like Kubernetes, Helm and Hashicorp Vault. By using the Leverage CLI , our binary will help you to quickly bootstrap your AWS Landing Zone in a matter of hours (or at most a few days). OSSVerse for Open Source Projects and ML Model Producers \u00b6 It's not just a pile of scripts It's not just another layer of untested, one time and stand-alone developed scripts. The code is modularized and well designed under best practices, our Leverage CLI has both unit and integration tests. While our Terraform code has been extensively E2E tested. Moreover, 100% of the code is yours (to modify, extend, reuse, etc), with no vendor locking and vendor licensing fees. We use the MIT license, so you can take the code, modify it and use it as your private code. All we ask in return is a friendly greeting and that (if possible) consider contributing to binbash Leverage project. Implement Leverage yourself or we can deploy it for you! DevOps culture and methodologies Team agility and continuous improvements based on feedback loops are some of the main drivers of cloud adoption, and IAC's goal of reducing the frequency of deployment of both infrastructure and applications are some of the most important aspects of DevOps practices. We continue to apply these methodologies to achieve a DevOps first culture. We have experienced and demonstrated their potential and have practiced them in dozens of projects over the past 5 years. The Leverage reference architecture for AWS combines a set of application best practices, technology patterns and a common CI/CD deployment approach through Leverage CLI for all your application environments. As a result, we are pursuing a world-class software delivery performance through optimized collaboration, communication, reliability, stability, scalability and security at ever-decreasing cost and effort. Repeatable, composable and extensible immutable infrastructure The best high-performance development teams create and recreate their development and production environments using infrastructure as code (IaC) as part of their daily development processes. The Leverage CLI allows to build repeatable and immutable infrastructure. So your cloud development, staging and production environments will consistently be the same. OSSVerse for Open Source Assurance Service Providers \u00b6 Provisioning infrastructure as code (Iac) Instead of manually provisioning infrastructure, the real benefits of cloud adoption come from orchestrating infrastructure through code. However, this is really challenging to achieve, there are literally thousands of tiny things and configs to consider and they all seem to take forever. Our experience is that it can take teams up to 24 months to achieve a desired infra state in AWS. By using Leverage you could get your AWS Landing-Zone in few weeks, or your entire AWS Well-Architected based cloud solution within 1 to 3 months (depending on your project complexity needs). We've done it before (don't reinvent the wheel) Often, development teams have similar and recurring requests such as: iam, networking, security, storage, databases, compute and secret management, etc. binbash Leverage has been proven in dozen of project to create software-defined (IaC) AWS environments. Best practices baked in the code Leverage provides IaC reference architecture for AWS hosted applications infrastructure. This is baked into the code as a combination of the best AWS Well-Architected framework practices and the experience of having successfully orchestrated many customers to AWS cloud. On-demand infra deployment Leverage provides your DevOps, Cloud, SRE and Development teams with the ability to provision on-demand infrastructure, granting that it will meet the rigorous security requirements of modern cloud native best practices. It fully implements AWS Well-Architected Framework (WAF) and best DevOps practices, including practices, including collaboration, version control, CI/CD, continuous testing, cloud infrastructure and losely couple architectures. Easier to support and maintain Leverage IaC approach significantly reduce your AWS infra deployment, config and support burden and reduce risk. Our code backed provisioning has been rigorously tested many times, eliminating the possibility of manual errors. Because the entire infrastructure is deployed from the same proven code, the consistency your cloud environments will simplify your setup and maintenance. Use the versioned code to iterate and improve, extend or compose your internal processes as your cloud operating model evolves. There is no vendor lock-in. You own the solution With Leverage you own 100% of the code with no lock-in clauses. If you choose to leave Leverage , you will still have your entire AWS cloud infrastructure that you can access and manage. If you drop Leverage , you will still have your entire cloud native infrastructure code (Terraform, Helm, Ansible, Python). It\u2019s 100% Open Source on GitHub and is free to use with no strings attached under MIT license (no licensing fees), and you are free to commercially and privately use, distribute and modify.","title":"Roles you can play"},{"location":"concepts/roles-you-can-play/#ossverse-for-open-source-projects-and-ml-model-consumers","text":"Accelerate development and optimize costs Annual cost savings are a new standard and best practice.

So your cloud development, staging and production environments will consistently be the same.","title":"OSSVerse for Open Source Projects and ML Model Producers"},{"location":"concepts/roles-you-can-play/#ossverse-for-open-source-assurance-service-providers","text":"Provisioning infrastructure as code (Iac) Instead of manually provisioning infrastructure, the real benefits of cloud adoption come from orchestrating infrastructure through code. However, this is really challenging to achieve, there are literally thousands of tiny things and configs to consider and they all seem to take forever. Our experience is that it can take teams up to 24 months to achieve a desired infra state in AWS. By using Leverage you could get your AWS Landing-Zone in few weeks, or your entire AWS Well-Architected based cloud solution within 1 to 3 months (depending on your project complexity needs). We've done it before (don't reinvent the wheel) Often, development teams have similar and recurring requests such as: iam, networking, security, storage, databases, compute and secret management, etc. binbash Leverage has been proven in dozen of project to create software-defined (IaC) AWS environments. Best practices baked in the code Leverage provides IaC reference architecture for AWS hosted applications infrastructure. This is baked into the code as a combination of the best AWS Well-Architected framework practices and the experience of having successfully orchestrated many customers to AWS cloud. On-demand infra deployment Leverage provides your DevOps, Cloud, SRE and Development teams with the ability to provision on-demand infrastructure, granting that it will meet the rigorous security requirements of modern cloud native best practices. It fully implements AWS Well-Architected Framework (WAF) and best DevOps practices, including practices, including collaboration, version control, CI/CD, continuous testing, cloud infrastructure and losely couple architectures. Easier to support and maintain Leverage IaC approach significantly reduce your AWS infra deployment, config and support burden and reduce risk. Our code backed provisioning has been rigorously tested many times, eliminating the possibility of manual errors. Because the entire infrastructure is deployed from the same proven code, the consistency your cloud environments will simplify your setup and maintenance. Use the versioned code to iterate and improve, extend or compose your internal processes as your cloud operating model evolves. There is no vendor lock-in. You own the solution With Leverage you own 100% of the code with no lock-in clauses. If you choose to leave Leverage , you will still have your entire AWS cloud infrastructure that you can access and manage. If you drop Leverage , you will still have your entire cloud native infrastructure code (Terraform, Helm, Ansible, Python).

Repeatability: Allows your infra to be automatically instantiated, making it easy to build multiple identical envs. Troubleshooting: Check source control and see exactly what changed in the env. As long as you are diligent and don\u2019t make manual envs changes, then IaC can be a game changer. DR: Require the ability to set up an alternate env in a different DC or Region. IaC makes this a much more manageable prospect. Auditability: You will need to be able to audit both changes and access to an env, IaC gives you this right out of the box. Visibility: As an env expands over time, is challenging to tell what has been provisioned. In the #cloud this can be a huge #cost issue. IaC allows tracking your resources. Portability: Some IaC techs are #multicloud. Also, translating #Terraform from one cloud provider to another is considerably more simple than recreating your entire envs in a cloud-specific tool.
